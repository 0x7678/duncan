Duncan - Blind SQL injector skeleton
====================================

```
"I may be blind, but there are some things I still see."
```


This is a skeleton to implement custom blind SQL injection exploits. It implements binary search and supports multi-threading.

You should implement Duncan.decide() for yourself.
